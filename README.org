* Overview

  A node module for defining JSON from a list of string inputs.  The main use case this library was
  designed for is command line input, but it will work in any scenario where the input is an array
  of strings.

** Installation

   : npm install args2json


** Example

   #+begin_src javascript
   const args2json = require('args2json');

   args2json([
       'something[0].id=1',
       'something[0].name="Arnold"',
       'something[1].id=2',
       'something[1].name="Dwayne"',
   ])
   // Returns
   {
       "something": [
           {
               "id": 1,
               "name": "Arnold"
           }, {
               "id": 2,
               "name": "Dwayne"
           }
       ]
   }
   #+end_src

* Similar projects 

  The projects below have similar designs around JSON input/output on the command line.  However,
  neither of them are modules that can be used by another program.

  - ~gron~ - https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron
  - ~catj~ - https://github.com/soheilpro/catj

  *Gron* is the most similar to our syntax with its ability to build JSON via ~ungron~, but it is
   only build for command line usage and it is written in Go.

  *Catj* only implements the ability to output JSON to a ~path=value~ form, but not the other way.
